## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Framework**: Dyad + Next.js
              --Dyad — A fully free, local, open-source alternative to Lovable.dev, V0, and Bolt. Dyad runs on your own device (Windows/Mac), avoids vendor lock-in, and lets users pick preferred AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.) — with more generous free allowances. Perfect for those who want code ownership and flexibility.
        
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
- **Deployment**: Vercel  
- **Version Control**: GitHub
